The biggest change is that we move our scenario to space.

So we didn't consider gravity anymore, but just modeling the forces applied on the drones.
('Use Gravity' is unchecked.)

We still modeled the aerodynamics behaviors, but because of switching the scenario, the original plan to demonstrate and evaluate do not apply anymore. Instead, we focused on navigating these ships through an asteroid field to a clickable destination.
