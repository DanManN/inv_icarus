The biggest changes is that we move our scenario to Space.

So we didn't consider gravity anymore, but just modeling the forces applied on the drones.
('Use Gravity' is unchecked.)

We still modeled the aerodynamics behaviors, but because of switching scenario, the original demonstrate and evaluate do not applies any more. Instead, we do cares more about the navigation qualities.
